=== Iconography

Atom comes bundled with the [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/) icon set. Use them to add icons to your packages.

===== Usage

Atom's usage of the Octicons differs just a bit from the [standard way](https://octicons.github.com/usage/). The biggest difference is in the naming of the icon classes. Instead of the `octicon octicon-` prefix, you would use a more generic `icon icon-` prefix.

As an example, to add a [monitor icon](https://octicons.github.com/icon/device-desktop/), use the `icon icon-device-desktop` classes in your markup:

```html
  <span class="icon icon-device-desktop"></span>
```

Or in case you're using [SpacePen](http://atom.github.io/space-pen/) it would be:

```coffeescript
  @span class: 'icon icon-device-desktop'
```

===== Size

Octicons look best with a `font-size` of `16px`. It's already used as the default, so you don't need to worry about it. In case you prefer a different icon size, try to use multiples of 16 (`32px`, `48px` etc.) for the sharpest result. Sizes in between are ok too, but might look a bit blurry for icons with straight lines.

===== Usabiltiy

Although icons can make your UI visually applealing, when used without a text label, it can be hard to guess its meaning. In cases where space for a text label is insufficient, consider adding a [tooltip](https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/TooltipManager) that appears on hover. Or a more subtle `title="label"` attribute would already help as well.
