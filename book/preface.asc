== Introduction

Welcome to the Flight Manual for Atom, the Hackable Text Editor of the 21st Century.

In the very simplest terms, Atom is a hackable text editor. It is like any other text editor in that you generally use it to open plain text files like computer programs, modify them and save them again. It is also much more in that it's built on well known web technologies such as HTML and CoffeeScript and is quite easy to customize, extend and modify.

In this book, we'll cover everything from the basics that you need to know to edit files like an elementary school student all the way to building brand new Atom-like applications with the shell that underlies Atom. We'll also cover everything in between.

Strap into your seat and get your oxygen tank ready, we're about to take off.
