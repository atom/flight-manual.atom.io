### Atom Selections

Text selections in Atom support a number of actions, such as scoping deletion, indentation and search actions, and marking text for actions such as quoting and bracketing.

Selections mirror many of the movement commands. They're actually exactly the same keybindings as the movement commands, but with a <kbd class="platform-all">Shift</kbd> key added in.
