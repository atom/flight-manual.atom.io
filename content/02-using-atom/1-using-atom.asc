== Using Atom

Now that we've covered the very basics of Atom, we are ready to see how to really start getting the most out of using it. In this chapter we'll look at how to find and install new packages in order to add new functionality, how to find and install new themes, how to work with and manipulate text in a more advanced way, how to customize the editor in any way you wish, how to work with Git for version control and more.

At the end of this chapter, you should have a customized environment that you're comfortable in and you should be able to change, create and move through your text like a master.

=== Summary

At this point you should be something of an Atom master user. You should be able to navigate and manipulate your text and files like a wizard. You should also be able to customize Atom backwards and forwards to make it look and act just how you want it to.

In the next chapter, we're going to kick it up a notch: we'll take a look at changing and adding new functionality to the core of Atom itself. We're going to start creating packages for Atom. If you can dream it, you can build it.
