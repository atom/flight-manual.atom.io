### How do I preview web page changes automatically?

There are a couple different approaches, for example:

* [browser-plus](https://atom.io/packages/browser-plus) gives a reasonably full browser implementation within Atom
* [livereload](https://atom.io/packages/livereload) gives you a preview in any browser, but requires you to save the file first.

Other packages may be available now, you can search for Atom packages on the [packages site](https://atom.io/packages).
