### I have a question about a specific Atom community package. Where is the best place to ask it?

The best place to get a question answered quickly is probably the Issues list for that specific package. You can find the Issues list for a package by going to that package's page on https://atom.io and clicking the Bugs button:

And you can always ask Atom-related questions in the [official Atom message board](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions). Someone here may know the answer! It's just with over 3,500 packages (as of early February 2016), the forum members may not know all answers for all packages :grinning:
