=== Installing Atom

To get started with Atom, we'll need to get it on our system. This section will go over installing Atom on Mac, Windows and Linux, as well as the basics of how to build it from source.

Installing Atom should be fairly simple on any of these systems. Generally you can simply go to https://atom.io and at the top of the page you should see a download button as in <<_download_button>>.

The buttons should be specific to your platform and easily installable. However, let's go over them here in a bit of detail.

==== Atom on Mac

Atom was originally built for Mac and should be a simple setup process. You can either hit the download button from the atom.io site or you can go to the Atom releases page at:

https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest

Here you can download the `atom-mac.zip` file explicitly.

Once you have that file, you can click on it to extract the binary and then drag the new `Atom` application into your "Applications" folder.

When you first open Atom, it will try to install the `atom` and `apm` commands for use in the terminal. In some cases, Atom might not be able to install these commands because it needs an administrator password. To check if Atom was able to install the `atom` command, for example, open a terminal window and type `which atom`. If the `atom` command has been installed, you'll see something like this:

  $ which atom
  /usr/local/bin/atom
  $

If the `atom` command wasn't installed, the `which` command won't return anything:

  $ which atom
  $

To install the `atom` and `apm` commands, run "Window: Install Shell Commands" from the https://atom.io/docs/latest/getting-started-atom-basics#command-palette[Command Palette], which will prompt you for an administrator password.

==== Atom on Windows

Atom is available with a Windows installer that can be downloaded from https://atom.io or from https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest[Atom Releases] named AtomSetup.exe

This will install Atom, add the `atom` and `apm` commands to your `PATH`, create shortcuts on the desktop and in the start menu, add an "Open with Atom" context menu in the Explorer and make Atom available for association with files using "Open with..."

===== Portable mode for Windows
Atom can also be run in portable mode on Windows allowing it to be placed on a removable storage device where it will also store its settings, packages, cache, etc. so you can easily take it from machine to machine without needing to install anything.

To get started with Atom in portable mode:

. Download atom-windows.zip from https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest[Atom Releases]
. Extract atom-windows.zip to your removable storage device
. Launch atom.exe from the extracted Atom folder
. Once Atom has launched it will create a .atom folder in %USERPROFILE%
. Move that .atom folder to be alongside your Atom folder on your removable storage device

Now whenever you launch atom.exe from your removable storage device it will operate in portable mode and store all its settings and packages in the .atom folder on the device.

Note that there are some limitations to portable mode:

* No Explorer integration or command-line PATH setup
* The .atom folder must be alongside the folder containing atom.exe (not inside it)
* The .atom folder must be writeable
* The ATOM_HOME environment variable must not be set (this overrides portable behavior)

==== Atom on Linux

To install Atom on Linux, you can download a https://atom.io/download/deb[Debian package] or https://atom.io/download/rpm[RPM package] either from the https://atom.io[main Atom website] at atom.io or from the Atom project releases page at https://github.com/atom/atom/releases.

On Debian, you would install the Debian package with `dpkg -i`:

  $ sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb

On RedHat or another RPM based system, you would use the `rpm -i` command:

  $ rpm -i atom.x86_64.rpm

==== Atom from Source

If none of those options works for you or you just want to build Atom from source, you can also do that.

There are detailed and up to date build instructions for Mac, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD at: https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/docs/build-instructions

In general, you need Git, a C++ toolchain, and Node to build it. See the repository documentation for detailed instructions.

==== Setting up a Proxy

If you're using a proxy, you can configure https://github.com/atom/apm[apm] (Atom Package Manager) to use it by setting the `https-proxy` config in your `~/.atom/.apmrc` file:

```
https-proxy = https://9.0.2.1:0
```

If you are behind a firewall and seeing SSL errors when installing packages, you can disable strict SSL by putting the following in your `~/.atom/.apmrc` file:

```
strict-ssl = false
```

You can run `apm config get https-proxy` to verify it has been set correctly, and running `apm config list` lists all custom config settings.
